        <h3 id="j"><i>>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create the structure and layout of web pages. HTML documents consist of a series of elements, and these elements are defined using HTML tags. HTML tags are essential building blocks that define the structure and content of a webpage. In this article, we'll explore what HTML tags are, how they work, and provide detailed examples of common HTML tags.
Understanding HTML Tags.HTML tags are composed of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. The opening tag marks the beginning of an element, and the closing tag marks the end. The content is the information or structure that falls between the opening and closing tags. Here's the basic structure of an HTML tag:
